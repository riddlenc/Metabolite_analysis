## Metabolite Analysis

The protocols and analysis scripts found here are used to measure metabolite levels in _Drosophila melanogaster_.  Specifically, we are interested in measuring the following metabolites: 
1. Triglycerides
2. Glycerol
3. Glucose
4. Total protein

These metabolites can be measured efficiently using colorimetric assays in a 96 well plate format and can be measured either on whole animals or dissected tissues.

### Glycerol and Triglycerides
The protocol we are currently using determines glycerol and triglyceride levels with the same assay.  Thus, there is one protocol and one analysis script for both of these metabolites. 
  - Protocol
  - Analysis script

### Glucose
  - Protocol
  - Analysis script

### Total protein

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/riddlenc/Metabolite_analysis/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/riddlenc/Metabolite_analysis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
