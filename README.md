# Metabolite_analysis


The protocols and analysis scripts found here are used to measure metabolite levels in _Drosophila melanogaster_.  Specifically, we are interested in measuring the following metabolites: 
1. Triglycerides
2. Glycerol
3. Glucose
4. Total protein

These metabolites can be measured efficiently using colorimetric assays in a 96 well plate format and can be measured either on whole animals or dissected tissues.

### Glycerol and Triglycerides
The protocol we are currently using determines glycerol and triglyceride levels with the same assay.  Thus, there is one protocol and one analysis script for both of these metabolites.
