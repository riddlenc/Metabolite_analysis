## Triglyceride Assay

This protocol is intended to be used with Serum Triglyceride Determination kit from Sigma [TR0100-1KT](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/tr0100?gclid=CjwKCAjwpMOIBhBAEiwAy5M6YIeW9ngR5556P2jLO1r8CdaP6nECVMA9bpeBPX6nRHadZBIK43v14xoC9qwQAvD_BwE).  Here are the [instructions provided by the manufacturer] . 

### Tissue Homogenization

1.	Make Lysis Buffer.
  Reagents needed: 
  -	0.01 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
  -	1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4)
  -	ddH<sub>2</sub>O
  
  For 50ml solution:
  -	2.5 ml of 0.2 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<subb>4</sub> 
  -	95 &mu;l of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 7.4)
  -	ddH2O to 50 ml (~47.5 ml)
  
  Store on ice.
  

2.	Homogenize flies in 75 &mu;l of lysis buffer.
    We typically use pools of 5-10 animals or dissected animal tissues. Homogenization can be done by hand using one of the blue pestles that fit the bottom of an   epptube (autoclaved).  Alternatively, homogenization can be done with a bead beater or mixer mill. 
    
3.	Centrifuge the sample to pellet fly debris (can just use the bench top mini centrifuge like when doing DNA isolations). Move homogenate to new epptube. Discard old epptube with fly debris.

4.	Store fly sample (homogenate) at -20C until ready to use.
 
5.	Before freezing the homogenate, prepare a diluted sample for the triglyceride assay (5 &mu;l of homogenate + 45 &mu;l of lysis buffer).  Store at -20Â°C if not using immediately.
